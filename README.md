# three_led_arduino_control
controls 3 LED's with a dip switch to then output different effects based on which dip switches are flipped

As part of the 30 days lost in space challenge from inventr.io this is day 5 of the 30 days

This is my project built off of the previous lesson involving a dipswitch with 3 switches and 3 LEDs that turn on based on which DIP switch is currently HIGH.

I've added conditionals and am using Morse Code to convey messages from the LED's when certain combinations of switchs are turned on.

The circuit below uses 6 x 220ohm resistors, 3 standard LED's, 1 x dipswitch (3 switch), Arduino Uno
